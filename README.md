# You would need to develop a static web page of the attached design in the way you see more fit for purpose (using html and css/scss).
You can download the files you will need for the test from here: https://we.tl/7NccFU3uYv
This contains a .psd and a .jpg files you can use as reference.

We will judge:
Markup (HTML)
Styles (CSS/SCSS)
Precision of UI (how similar is the result submitted to the design provided)
Extra work put into it (be creative, if you have the time for it!)

You can send back the completed test to me (at ...@redsnapper.net) in a .zip file (or similar) and I will get back to you as soon as we review it next week.
The deadline is the 16th of July 9:00 AM.
